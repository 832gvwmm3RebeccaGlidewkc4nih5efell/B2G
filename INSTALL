This document assumes you've already cloned the b2g repo to the path
$B2G.


 Dependencies
--------------

* You need to have adb set up to allow your machine to talk to your
  phone.  Follow the instructions at

    http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html

  Note when setting up udev, you need to specify the identifier for
  your device's manufacturer in *lower case* hex.  That is,

    ATTR{idVendor}=="0bb4"

  not "0BB4".  If you use upper-case hex, the USB permissions will not
  be set up correctly and heimdall will only work if you give it
  superuser powers.

* If you're building for the Galaxy S II, you need to install
  "Heimdall" to be able to flash your phone with B2G.  Follow the
  instructions at

    http://www.glassechidna.com.au/products/heimdall/

  (Even if you're not building for the Galaxy S II, it's not a bad
  idea to install Heimdall anyway.)

* There are a few other dependencies you may find necessary to
  install.  These were found to be necessary when building on a ubuntu
  64bit system.

    # sudo apt-get install ia32-libs gcc-multilib g++-multilib bison \
      flex gperf lib32z1-dev lib32ncurses5-dev lib32ncursesw5-dev \
      libidl-dev lib32gomp1 autoconf2.13 ccache libx11-dev \
      lib32readline-gplv2-dev

  lib32readline-gplv2-dev is available for Ubuntu 11.10. For Ubuntu 10.10
  lib32readline5-dev seems to work fine.

 Additional dependencies when building android backend
-------------------------------------------------------

* Sadly, B2G currently depends on not only the android source, but
  also the android SDK and NDK.  These dependencies will be removed
  eventually, but for now you need to install both.  Follow the
  instructions at

    http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html
    http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html

  From here on, this document assumes you installed the SDK to the
  path $ANDROID_SDK and the NDK to the path $ANDROID_NDK.

 Quick start
-------------

 == Samsung Galaxy SII / Nexus 4G ==

This only works if your bootloader is unlocked.  If it's not, or
you're not sure, follow the more detailed instructions below.  Make
sure to back up your phone before doing this.

$ cd $B2G
$ make sync
$ cat > local.mk << EOF
ANDROID_SDK="$ANDROID_SDK"
ANDROID_NDK="$ANDROID_NDK"
EOF
$ make config-nexuss4g   # or, make config-galaxy-s2
$ make flash

# temporary hack you may need

$ adb shell chmod -R 777 /data/system

 == Android Emulator ==

$ cd $B2G
$ make sync
$ make config-qemu
$ make
$ ./emu.sh

 Detailed instructions
-----------------------

These instructions assume you have followed the directions in the
"Dependencies" section.

 == Initialize repository ==

The repository is organized as a top-level B2G module with many
submodules for the kernel, gecko, and other userspace libraries.
Before doing anything else, you need to synchronize all these
submodules

$ cd $B2G
$ make sync

This takes a *long* time, so be patient.  Whenever you want to pull
from upstream again, just re-run |make sync|.

 == [TEMPORARY] Configure local SDK and NDK paths ==

We're using these currently for reasons not worth knowing.

# for android backend

$ cat > local.mk << EOF
ANDROID_SDK="$ANDROID_SDK"
ANDROID_NDK="$ANDROID_NDK"
EOF

# for gonk backend

$ cat > local.mk << EOF
WIDGET_BACKEND=gonk
EOF

 == Configure repo for your device ==

 Nexus S 4G: 
$ make config-nexuss4g

 Galaxy S II:
$ make config-galaxy-s2

 Android Emulator:
$ make config-qemu

This configures submodules appropriately for the given device, and for
devices with proprietary libraries, will attempt to download and
install the blobs.  The blobs may ask you to agree to an EULA before
they will install.

In the case of the Nexus S 4G at least, you don't *need* to install
the proprietary blobs if you don't want to; if you don't, the device
will function, only more slowly and without access to some sensors.

 == Build the code ==

This part is relatively simple

$ make -jN

where N is slightly more than the number of cores you have in your
machine.

This step can take a long time.  Subsequent rebuilds will usually be
much faster, though.

At this stage, if you're building from the Android emulator, you just
need to run the provided script and you're done.

$ ./emu.sh

 == Unlock your device's bootloader ==

This is only needed for the Nexus S 4G.

The step above builds host tools as well as the device image.  We need
the host tools to unlock the bootloader.

WARNING: This next command deletes *ALL* your user data.  Make sure
you back up beforehand.

$ make unlock-bootloader

If this works, you should see your device reboot into a
terminal-looking black screen with a large android logo in the middle
and some small text to the top-left and bottom-left.  Follow the
on-screen instructions to confirm unlocking the bootloader.  After
that, your device reboot.

 == Back up device ==

WARNING: Only tested with the Galaxy S II.  Instructions will be
different for other phones.  This backup process is absolutely
essential for the Galaxy S II because the B2G image is very unstable
there.

These steps install the "ClockworkMod" recovery image.  Among other
things, it lets you make full backups of the phone's partitions to the
sdcard, and restore them.  This is extraordinarily useful.  To install
ClockworkMod

$ cd /tmp
$ wget http://cmw.22aaf3.com/c1/recovery/recovery-clockwork-4.0.1.4-galaxys2.tar
$ tar xvf recovery-clockwork-*.tar
$ adb reboot download

This puts your phone into "download mode", in which it's ready to be
flashed using the "Odin" protocol.  Your phone should boot into a
screen that says something like, "Downloading, Do not turn off!".  If
not, something went wrong.  To actually flash ClockworkMod

$ heimdall flash --kernel zImage

When this finishes, your phone should reboot normally.  If not,
something went wrong, get help.  Finally, let's back up your phone's
current image

$ adb reboot recovery

This boots your phone into a screen that says "ClockworkMod Recovery"
at the top-left.  Follow the on-screen instructions to make a backup
image.

 == Flash device ==

The "image" to be flashed comprises the custom-built kernel and all
the userspace programs and libraries.

WARNING: This next command deletes *ALL* your user data.  Make sure
you back up beforehand.  If the image is bad, it can also *BRICK* your
phone.  Flash at your own risk.

NOTE: For the Galaxy S II, you must first reboot into recovery mode
(adb reboot recovery), then choose "wipe data/factory reset".  This
will be fixed.  BE SURE you don't reboot your phone before running the
following step.  That is, you should run "make flash" while your phone
is still in recovery mode.

$ make flash

If all goes well, you'll see the phone reboot into the bootloader,
then your host machine will report the progress of files it uploads
and installs on the device.  After finishing, the device will reboot.

# temporary hack you may need on the android backend

$ adb shell chmod -R 777 /data/system

# temporary hack you may need on the gonk backend, although the Makefile tries
# to do it for you.

$ adb shell chmod 755 /system/b2g/b2g

 == Kernel flashing ==

The kernel should also be flashed when using the gonk backend on a SII.
It only needs to be done once when switching to the gonk backend.
This will overwrite ClockworkMod.

GET A DOWNLOAD MODE JIG BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS!
The flashing process is known to fail.

$ make kernel
$ adb reboot download
$ heimdall flash --kernel boot/kernel-android-galaxy-s2/arch/arm/boot/zImage

 == Install Gaia ==

Gaia is the phone experience prototype being developed by Mozilla. It
is built into the system image by default. To update gaia on a flashed
device, run

$ make install-gaia

If you press the "Home" button on device, the Gaia homescreen will
reload.

== Troubleshooting ==

If you get a message at the end of the install-gecko process that says:
# /sbin/sh pm not found
Then this refers to the android package manager not working properly on the device.
The reason it's not working is that it doesn't have permissions to write to /data/system.
To fix:
1. $ adb push gecko/objdir-prof-android/dist/b2g-9.0a1.en-US.android-arm.apk /data/local/tmp/b2g.apk
2. $ adb shell
3. # chmod -R 777 /data/system
4. # sh /system/bin/pm install -r /data/local/tmp/b2g.apk
5. # reboot

Happy hacking.
